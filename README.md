# Cure Together

### ALWAYS CARING. ALWAYS HERE.

"Cure Together" is a platform which helps a person suffering from some medical problem connect to people recovered from the same complexity to receive the much needed mental and moral support they deserve from a person who has experienced it firsthand. Apart from moral guidance, people deprived of adequate knowledge and resources can also seek proper guidance and information about resources that can be helpful.
