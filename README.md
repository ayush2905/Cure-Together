# Cure Together

### ALWAYS CARING. ALWAYS HERE.

"Cure Together" is a platform which helps a person suffering from some medical problem connect to people recovered from the same complexity to receive the much needed mental and moral support they deserve from a person who has experienced it firsthand. Apart from moral guidance, people deprived of adequate knowledge and resources can also seek proper guidance and information about resources that can be helpful.

User can also share their issue by making a "Post" which will attract help from larger audience.
